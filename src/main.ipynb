    "# Simulation of a Cellular Telephony Network\n",
    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "# The telecommunication company XPhone has been receiving complaints from its subscribers\n",
    "# regarding quality of service (QoS) along a 40 km long highway connecting two major cities.\n",
    "# The highway is covered by its cellular telephony network. The company needs to decide\n",
    "# whether or not its system guarantees quality of service (QoS) in terms of percentages of\n",
    "# dropped calls and blocked calls. Some measurements have been made of the traffic in the\n",
    "# network on the highway. Your task is to model and simulate the system to determine\n",
    "# whether the system can meet the quality of service requirements, and if so, which fixed\n",
    "# channel allocation scheme offers the best service.\n",
    "# Quality of Service (QoS) Requirements\n",
    "# • blocked calls < 2%; and\n",
    "# • dropped calls < 1%\n",
    "# System Descriptions\n",
    "# The two-way highway is 40 km long. The company uses 20 base stations, each covers a cell\n",
    "# with 2 km diameter as shown in the figure below. There is no overlapping of cells. Where\n",
    "# the reach of one base station ends, the reach of the next base station starts. Each base station\n",
    "# has 10 channels so there are 10 channels available in each cell.\n",
    "# When a subscriber initiates a call from within a cell, a channel in the cell will be allocated to\n",
    "# the call. If no free channels are available in the base station, the call is blocked. When a\n",
    "# subscriber making a call crosses a cell boundary before the end of the 40-km highway, the\n",
    "# channel being used in the current cell is released and a new channel in the new cell has to be\n",
    "# acquired: this is called a Handover. If a channel is not available in the new base station\n",
    "# during a handover the call is dropped. When a subscriber making a call crosses the end of the\n",
    "# 40-km highway (either end), the call will be terminated and the channel being used is\n",
    "# released.\n",
    "# A Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) scheme is used. The company wants you to test at least\n",
    "# two FCA schemes:\n",
    "# (a) No channel reservation\n",
    "# (b) 9 channels are allocated to each cell for new calls and handovers and 1 channel is\n",
    "# reserved for handovers when the other 9 channels are not available. This means a new\n",
    "# call will not be allocated a channel if there is only one free channel left.\n",
    "# The company has provided the following measurements:\n",
    "# (a) Call initiation times and their first base stations\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# (b) Call durations\n",
    "# (c) Car speeds.\n",
    "# Assumptions\n",
    "# (a) The traffic volumes in the two directions are the same. This means the two directions of\n",
    "# cars travelling along the highway have equal probabilities.\n",
    "# (b) A car maintains the same speed during a call.\n",
    "# (c) The position of the car initiating a call in a cell is uniformly distributed along the section\n",
    "# of the highway covered by the base station.\n",
    "# Your Tasks\n",
    "# 1. Analyze the measured data to find what distributions the inter-arrival times of calls, the\n",
    "# locations where calls are generated, the call durations, and car speeds follow\n",
    "# respectively. You also need to find the parameter values of these distributions. (The\n",
    "# measured data are provided in the file “PCS_TEST_DETERMINSTIC”)\n",
    "# 2. Develop a discrete-event simulator.\n",
    "# 3. Run your simulator multiple times, each with a warm-up period for different FCA\n",
    "# schemes to investigate how handover reservation scheme may affect the quality of\n",
    "# service (i.e., blocking and dropping probabilities). Calculate the average values of the\n",
    "# percentages of dropped calls and blocked calls and indicate the statistical significance.\n",
    "# Answer the following questions: Is the current system able to meet the quality of service\n",
    "# requirements and if so how many channels should be reserved for handover for best\n",
    "# service? (The percentage of dropped calls is defined as the number of dropped calls\n",
    "# divided by the total number of calls; and the percentage of blocked calls is defined as the\n",
    "# number of blocked calls divided by the total number of calls.)\n",
    "# The discrete-event simulator\n",
    "# You may implement the discrete-event simulator using any general purpose programming\n",
    "# language (e.g., Python, Java, C, or C++). You may use any PC in the Software Project\n",
    "# Laboratory or your own laptop. But you may not use a simulation package or a simulation\n",

    "# • Call initiation [time, speed, station, position, duration, direction]\n",
